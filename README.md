# Great-Quiz

https://dylanquaale.github.io/Great-Quiz/

## Description

I spent a ton of time on this project atleast 25 hours.
By far was the most challenging prject that I have done yet.
I restarted the whole project 3 times before finally ending with the results I have here.
I know it is not 100% perfect, but I understand the code that I have written and how it works.
The object of this challenge was to create a javascript quiz with javascript based questions.
To get stored into local storage.
I have a total of 8 questions.
Along with a timer to go with the quiz.
If you answer one right you get 10 points.
If you answer one wrong you lose 5 points.
The game is done when you finish with all the questions and an alert drops down showing your score.
Your answers are also logged showing wether they are correct or incorrect.

### Usage

To complete a quiz with all JS based questions.

#### Credits

Looked back to week 4 a ton for references.
Google and Stack Overflow were my best friends.
Had a tutor session with Corey Yates.
Did attend office hours.

##### License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
