# Great-Quiz
https://dylanquaale.github.io/Great-Quiz/


## Description
I spent a ton of time on this project.
By far was the most challenging prject that I have done yet.
I restarted the whole project 3 times before finally ending with the results I have here.
I know it is not 100% perfect, but I understand the code that I have written and how it works.
The object of this challenge was to create a javascript quiz with javascript based questions.
To get stored into local storage.
I have a total of 8 questions.
If you answer one right you get 10 points.
If you answer one wrong you lose 5 points.
The game is done when you finish with all the questions and an alert drops down showing your score.
Your answers are also logged showing wether they are correct or incorrect.
